    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The European Theater of World War II stretched from the Arctic to North Africa, from the Atlantic coast to deep inside the Soviet Union. It began with Germany's Blitzkrieg conquests of 1939-1940 and ended with Soviet and American forces meeting in the ruins of Nazi Germany in 1945.</p>
    <p>The war in Europe can be divided into three main fronts: the Eastern Front (Germany vs. Soviet Union), the Western Front (Germany vs. Britain, USA, and allies), and the Mediterranean/North African Front.</p>

    <h2>The Eastern Front</h2>
    <p>The Eastern Front was the largest and deadliest theater of World War II. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, it began a titanic struggle that would ultimately determine the war's outcome. Approximately 80% of German military casualties occurred on the Eastern Front.</p>
    <p>Major campaigns included Operation Barbarossa, the Siege of Leningrad, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and the final Soviet drive to Berlin. The scale of fighting was unprecedented: millions of soldiers clashed across a front line stretching thousands of miles.</p>

    <h2>The Western Front</h2>
    <p>After the fall of France in 1940, the Western Front was largely dormant until the D-Day invasion of June 1944. The main Western combat during this period was the strategic bombing campaign against Germany and the aerial Battle of Britain.</p>
    <p>The Normandy invasion opened a major second front that Germany could not sustain. American, British, Canadian, and Free French forces liberated Western Europe and invaded Germany itself, meeting Soviet forces on the Elbe River in April 1945.</p>

    <h2>The Mediterranean</h2>
    <p>The Mediterranean theater began with Italy's entry into the war in 1940. Fighting ranged across North Africa, where Britain and later America faced the German Afrika Korps, and into Italy itself after the 1943 invasion.</p>
    <p>Key campaigns included the Western Desert Campaign, the Battle of El Alamein, the invasion of Sicily, and the long Italian Campaign that lasted until the war's end.</p>
