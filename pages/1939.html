    <!-- Overview -->
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      1939 marked the beginning of World War II, a conflict that would ultimately claim between 70 and 85 million lives 
      and reshape the entire geopolitical landscape of the world. The year began with lingering hopes for peace but ended 
      with Europe engulfed in war as Nazi Germany demonstrated the devastating effectiveness of its new military doctrine: Blitzkrieg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate cause of the war was Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, but the roots of the conflict 
      stretched back to the unresolved tensions of World War I, the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the global 
      economic depression of the 1930s, and the rise of aggressive fascist regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan.

    <h2>Key Events of 1939</h2>

    <h3>Pre-War Tensions (January - August)</h3>
    <p>
      Before the war officially began, 1939 saw a series of aggressive moves by Nazi Germany that made conflict increasingly 
      inevitable. In March, Germany violated the Munich Agreement by occupying the remainder of Czechoslovakia, establishing 
      the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. This demonstrated that Hitler's ambitions extended far beyond uniting 
      ethnic Germans and shattered any remaining illusions about his intentions.

    <h3>September: War Erupts</h3>
    <p>
      On September 1, 1939, without a formal declaration of war, German forces invaded Poland from the north, south, and west. 
      The invasion showcased Germany's revolutionary Blitzkrieg ("lightning war") tactics—combining fast-moving armor, mobile 
      infantry, and close air support to achieve rapid breakthroughs and encirclement of enemy forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Britain and France, bound by treaty obligations to Poland, issued ultimatums to Germany demanding withdrawal. 
      When these were ignored, both nations declared war on Germany on September 3. However, their armies remained 
      largely static on the Western Front during what became known as the "Phony War" or "Sitzkrieg."
    </p>

    <div class="quote-block">
      "This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that unless we heard 
      from them by eleven o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war 
      would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently 
      this country is at war with Germany."
      <cite>— Neville Chamberlain, September 3, 1939</cite>

    <h3>The Winter War</h3>
    <p>
      On November 30, 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, beginning what became known as the Winter War. 
      Stalin sought to secure Soviet borders by demanding territorial concessions from Finland, particularly 
      land near Leningrad. When Finland refused, the Soviets attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, the Red Army struggled against Finnish defenders, 
      who used the harsh winter terrain and guerrilla tactics to devastating effect. The Winter War exposed 
      serious weaknesses in Soviet military organization and would have significant implications for 
      Hitler's future calculations about invading the USSR.

    <!-- The Fall of Poland -->
    <h2>The Fall of Poland</h2>
    <p>
      The Polish campaign was over in just five weeks, demonstrating the lethal effectiveness of Blitzkrieg warfare. 
      The Polish Army, though brave and determined, was hopelessly outmatched. The Luftwaffe destroyed most of 
      Poland's air force on the ground in the first days of fighting, giving Germany complete air superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      German Panzer divisions, supported by motorized infantry and dive-bombers, achieved rapid breakthroughs 
      and encircled Polish forces before they could establish defensive positions. The Soviet invasion from 
      the east on September 17 sealed Poland's fate, as the country was caught between two massive armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, with millions of Poles coming under brutal 
      occupation regimes. The first ghettos were established for Poland's large Jewish population, 
      foreshadowing the horrors to come.

    <!-- Significance -->
    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      The events of 1939 set the stage for six years of total war. The invasion of Poland demonstrated 
      that Hitler's aggression could not be appeased and that military force would be necessary to stop 
      Nazi expansion. The failure of Britain and France to provide meaningful assistance to Poland 
      during its desperate struggle would have lasting implications for Allied strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact shocked the world by uniting two ideological enemies—Nazi Germany and 
      Communist Soviet Union—and gave Hitler a free hand in Western Europe. However, this unholy alliance 
      would prove temporary, setting the stage for the even more devastating conflict on the Eastern Front 
      that would begin in 1941.
