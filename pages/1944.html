    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>1944 was the year of liberation. On June 6—D-Day—Allied forces launched the largest amphibious invasion in history, landing on the beaches of Normandy and beginning the liberation of Western Europe. By year's end, France, Belgium, and much of the Netherlands had been freed from Nazi occupation.</p>
    <p>In the East, the Soviet Operation Bagration destroyed German Army Group Center, advancing the front line hundreds of miles westward. In the Pacific, American forces returned to the Philippines, and the Japanese navy was shattered at Leyte Gulf.</p>

    <h2>Key Events</h2>

    <h3>D-Day: Operation Overlord (June 6)</h3>
    <p>June 6, 1944—D-Day—remains the most famous military operation in history. After years of planning, over 156,000 Allied troops landed on five beaches in Normandy: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. It was the largest amphibious invasion ever attempted.</p>
    <p>The assault was supported by 6,939 vessels, 11,590 aircraft, and elaborate deception operations that convinced Germany the main attack would come at Calais. Despite fierce resistance, especially at Omaha Beach, by day's end the Allies had established beachheads and begun the liberation of France.</p>

    <h3>Eastern Front: Operation Bagration</h3>
    <p>While the world focused on Normandy, the Soviets launched Operation Bagration—one of the most devastating military operations in history. Beginning June 22 (the third anniversary of Barbarossa), Soviet forces destroyed German Army Group Center, killing or capturing 400,000 German soldiers.</p>

    <h3>Pacific: Return to the Philippines</h3>
    <p>In October, American forces landed on Leyte in the Philippines—fulfilling MacArthur's famous promise: "I shall return." The Japanese navy committed virtually all its remaining strength to stop the invasion, resulting in the largest naval battle in history.</p>

    <h3>The Battle of the Bulge</h3>
    <p>In December, Hitler gambled everything on a surprise offensive through the Ardennes—the same route used in 1940. German forces achieved complete surprise, creating a "bulge" in Allied lines. The assault threatened to split Allied forces and capture the vital port of Antwerp.</p>
    <p>Despite initial setbacks, American forces held crucial positions including Bastogne, where the surrounded 101st Airborne famously replied "Nuts!" to German surrender demands. By late January, the offensive had failed, costing Germany irreplaceable men and equipment.</p>

    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>1944 marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. By year's end, Allied forces had liberated France, Belgium, and much of the Netherlands. Soviet forces had pushed deep into Eastern Europe. Germany was being squeezed from all sides, its cities devastated by strategic bombing, its armies bled white.</p>
    <p>Yet the war was not over. Germany's desperate counterattack in the Bulge showed the Wehrmacht still had fight left. The final year of the war would see some of the most brutal fighting yet—and the full revelation of Nazi atrocities as Allied forces liberated the concentration camps.</p>
