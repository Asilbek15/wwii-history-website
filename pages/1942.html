    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>1942 marked the crucial turning point of World War II. At the year's beginning, the Axis powers seemed triumphant—Germany controlled most of Europe, Japan dominated the Pacific. By year's end, the tide had irrevocably turned with decisive Allied victories at Stalingrad, Midway, El Alamein, and Guadalcanal.</p>
    <p>The year also saw the implementation of the "Final Solution"—the Nazi plan for the systematic extermination of European Jews. The Wannsee Conference in January formalized the genocide that would claim six million lives.</p>

    <h2>Key Events</h2>

    <h3>Japanese Expansion & Midway</h3>
    <p>The first half of 1942 saw Japan conquer a vast empire across the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Burma—all fell to Japanese forces. By May, Japan controlled territory stretching from the borders of India to the islands of the Pacific.</p>
    <p>The Battle of Midway changed everything. American codebreakers had deciphered Japanese plans, allowing Admiral Nimitz to position his carriers for a devastating ambush. In just minutes on June 4, American dive bombers destroyed three Japanese carriers; a fourth followed that afternoon.</p>

    <h3>Stalingrad: The Bloodiest Battle</h3>
    <p>The <a href="battles.html#stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> began in August 1942 and would become the bloodiest battle in human history. German forces fought street by street, building by building, for control of the city bearing Stalin's name. By November, they controlled 90% of the urban area.</p>
    <p>Then the Soviets struck back. Operation Uranus encircled the German 6th Army and parts of the 4th Panzer Army—over 300,000 men trapped in a freezing pocket. Hitler forbade retreat; Göring promised air resupply that never came. The German surrender in February 1943 was a catastrophic blow from which the Wehrmacht never recovered.</p>

    <h3>North Africa & El Alamein</h3>
    <p>In North Africa, Rommel's Afrika Korps had pushed deep into Egypt, threatening the Suez Canal. The First Battle of El Alamein in July halted the German advance. The Second Battle of El Alamein in October-November, under General Montgomery, decisively defeated Rommel and began the liberation of North Africa.</p>

    <h3>The Final Solution</h3>
    <p>On January 20, 1942, senior Nazi officials met at Wannsee to coordinate the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question." The conference formalized the plan for the systematic genocide of European Jews. Death camps began operation, including the most notorious: <a href="holocaust.html">Auschwitz-Birkenau</a>.</p>

    <div class="info-box warning">
      <h4>The Holocaust Intensifies</h4>
      <p>1942 saw the peak of deportations to extermination camps. Auschwitz-Birkenau began mass gassing operations. The Warsaw Ghetto deportations sent over 300,000 Jews to Treblinka.</p>

    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>1942 was the year the Axis tide crested and began to recede. At Midway, Japan lost the offensive capability that had made its rapid conquests possible. At Stalingrad, Germany suffered a defeat from which it never recovered—the strategic initiative passed permanently to the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>The year also saw the Allied powers coordinate their strategy. The "Germany First" policy was confirmed, the massive industrial capacity of the United States began to make itself felt, and the foundations were laid for the campaigns that would liberate Europe and defeat Japan.</p>
