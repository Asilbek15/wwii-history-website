    <h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
    <p>The atomic bomb was the product of the Manhattan Project—a secret American research program that employed over 125,000 workers and cost nearly $2 billion (equivalent to roughly $30 billion today). The project, led by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, brought together the greatest scientific minds of the era to achieve what many thought impossible.</p>
    <p>The project was driven by fear that Nazi Germany might develop atomic weapons first. Ironically, Germany surrendered before any atomic bomb was ready. The weapons were instead used against Japan.</p>

    <h2>The Decision to Use the Bomb</h2>
    <p>By summer 1945, Japan had clearly lost the war but showed no signs of surrendering. The Japanese military code of Bushido deemed surrender dishonorable—soldiers and civilians alike were expected to fight to the death.</p>
    <p>American military planners estimated that invading Japan could cost hundreds of thousands of American lives and millions of Japanese. The battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa—where Japanese defenders fought almost to the last man—gave a preview of what an invasion would entail.</p>
    <p>President Harry Truman, who learned of the bomb's existence only after becoming president in April 1945, faced an agonizing choice: use a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, or launch an invasion that could cost even more lives.</p>

    <div class="quote-block">
      "I realize the tragic significance of the atomic bomb... It is an awful responsibility which has come to us... We thank God that it has come to us, instead of to our enemies; and we pray that He may guide us to use it in His ways and for His purposes."
      <cite>— President Harry Truman, August 6, 1945</cite>

    <h2>Hiroshima: August 6, 1945</h2>
    <p>At 8:15 AM local time on August 6, 1945, the B-29 bomber <em>Enola Gay</em>, piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets, dropped the uranium bomb "Little Boy" on Hiroshima. The bomb detonated approximately 1,900 feet above the city with a force equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT.</p>
    <p>The explosion instantly killed an estimated 70,000-80,000 people. Tens of thousands more would die in the following months from burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries. By year's end, the death toll reached approximately 140,000.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Nagasaki: August 9, 1945</h2>
    <p>When Japan did not immediately surrender after Hiroshima, a second bomb was prepared. The plutonium bomb "Fat Man" was more powerful than Little Boy. On August 9, the B-29 <em>Bockscar</em> dropped it on Nagasaki after the primary target, Kokura, was obscured by clouds.</p>
    <p>Despite being more powerful (21 kilotons), the bomb killed fewer people than at Hiroshima due to Nagasaki's hilly terrain, which limited the blast's spread. Approximately 40,000 people died instantly; the total death toll reached 70,000-80,000 by year's end.</p>
    <p>That same day, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria, adding to the pressure on Japan's leadership.</p>

    <h2>Japan's Surrender</h2>
    <p>On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender in a recorded radio address—the first time most Japanese had heard their emperor's voice. He cited "a new and most cruel bomb" as the reason for surrender.</p>
    <p>The formal surrender ceremony took place on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS <em>Missouri</em> in Tokyo Bay. World War II, after six years and an estimated 70-85 million deaths, was finally over.</p>

    <div class="quote-block">
      "The enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization."
      <cite>— Emperor Hirohito, August 15, 1945</cite>

    <h2>The Debate</h2>
    <p>The decision to use atomic weapons remains one of history's most debated topics. Supporters argue that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The bombs ended the war quickly, saving lives on both sides</li>
      <li>An invasion of Japan would have caused far more casualties</li>
      <li>Japan's military showed no willingness to surrender</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Critics contend that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Japan was already defeated and might have surrendered soon</li>
      <li>The bombs were used partly to intimidate the Soviet Union</li>
      <li>Targeting civilian populations was morally unjustifiable</li>
      <li>A demonstration on an uninhabited area might have sufficed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This debate continues today, with historians and ethicists finding merit on both sides.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>The atomic bombings ushered in the nuclear age. The Cold War that followed saw the United States and Soviet Union amass arsenals capable of destroying civilization. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare—a fact that owes much to the horrifying images and testimony from those events.</p>
    <p>The bombings also raised fundamental questions about the ethics of warfare, the relationship between science and military power, and humanity's capacity for self-destruction that remain relevant today.</p>
