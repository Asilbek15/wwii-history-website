      <h4>Content Warning</h4>
      <p>This page contains information about genocide, mass murder, and the systematic persecution of Jewish people and other groups. This history is presented to honor the memory of victims and ensure such atrocities are never forgotten or repeated.</p>

    <h2>What Was the Holocaust?</h2>
    <p>The Holocaust (also known by its Hebrew name, Shoah, meaning "catastrophe") was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945. The term refers specifically to the genocide of Jews, though the Nazis also murdered millions of others they deemed "undesirable."</p>
    <p>The Holocaust was not a sudden event but a gradual process of escalating persecution: from legal discrimination to social isolation, from forced emigration to mass murder. It represents humanity's capacity for industrial-scale evil and serves as a permanent warning about the consequences of hatred, bigotry, and totalitarianism.</p>

    <h2>Timeline of Persecution</h2>
    
    <h3>1933-1938: Legal Persecution</h3>
    <p>When Hitler came to power in January 1933, the Nazis began implementing anti-Jewish policies. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 stripped Jews of citizenship and prohibited marriage between Jews and non-Jewish Germans. Jews were progressively excluded from professions, businesses, and public life.</p>

    <h3>November 1938: Kristallnacht</h3>
    <p>On November 9-10, 1938, Nazi-organized mobs attacked Jewish communities across Germany and Austria. Synagogues were burned, businesses destroyed, and approximately 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. "Kristallnacht" (Night of Broken Glass) marked a turning point from legal persecution to physical violence.</p>

    <h3>1939-1941: Ghettos and Mass Shootings</h3>
    <p>Following the invasion of Poland, Nazis forced Jews into crowded ghettos. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, mobile killing units called Einsatzgruppen followed the army, systematically murdering Jews, Roma, and Soviet officials. Over 1.5 million Jews were shot in these massacres.</p>

    <h3>1942-1945: The Final Solution</h3>
    <p>At the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, Nazi officials coordinated the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question"—the systematic extermination of all European Jews. Six death camps were established in occupied Poland: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, Chelmno, and Majdanek.</p>

    <h2>The Death Camps</h2>
    <p>Unlike concentration camps, which were primarily for imprisonment and forced labor, death camps (extermination camps) were built specifically for mass murder. Jews from across Europe were transported by rail in cattle cars to these facilities, where most were murdered within hours of arrival.</p>

    <h2>Other Victims</h2>
    <p>While the Holocaust specifically refers to the genocide of Jews, the Nazis also murdered millions of others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Roma (Gypsies):</strong> 200,000-500,000 murdered</li>
      <li><strong>Soviet POWs:</strong> 3.3 million died in German captivity</li>
      <li><strong>Poles:</strong> 1.8-2 million non-Jewish Poles killed</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled:</strong> 200,000+ killed in the T4 "euthanasia" program</li>
      <li><strong>Homosexuals:</strong> Thousands imprisoned; many died in camps</li>
      <li><strong>Political opponents, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Liberation</h2>
    <p>As Allied forces advanced, they liberated the camps. Soviet troops reached Majdanek in July 1944 and Auschwitz in January 1945. American and British forces liberated camps in Germany including Buchenwald, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen. The liberators found thousands of unburied corpses and barely alive survivors—evidence of Nazi atrocities that shocked the world.</p>

      "The things I saw beggar description... The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick."
      <cite>— General Dwight D. Eisenhower, after visiting Ohrdruf concentration camp, April 1945</cite>
    </div>

    <h2>Never Forget</h2>
    <p>The Holocaust stands as a permanent warning about the consequences of hatred, propaganda, and the failure of ordinary people to resist evil. International Holocaust Remembrance Day is observed on January 27—the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation.</p>
    <p>Remembering the Holocaust honors the six million Jewish victims and ensures that future generations understand how such horrors can occur—and must be prevented.</p>
