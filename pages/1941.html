    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>1941 transformed World War II from a primarily European conflict into a truly global war. Two events—Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June and Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December—brought the world's two largest nations into the fight against the Axis powers.</p>
    <p>Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the USSR, was the largest military operation in history. It would become the decisive theater of the European war, ultimately claiming more lives than any other front. Meanwhile, Pearl Harbor ended American isolationism and brought the industrial might of the United States into the conflict.</p>

    <h2>Key Events</h2>

    <h3>Operation Barbarossa (June 22)</h3>
    <p>At dawn on June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany launched the largest military invasion in history. Operation Barbarossa deployed over 3.8 million Axis soldiers against the Soviet Union along an 1,800-mile front. Hitler sought to destroy Soviet communism, seize the vast agricultural and oil resources of the USSR, and create "living space" (Lebensraum) for German settlers.</p>
    <p>The initial German advance was stunning. Caught off guard despite numerous warnings, Soviet forces suffered catastrophic losses. By December, German forces had advanced to the outskirts of Moscow and Leningrad, and the Soviets had lost over 4 million soldiers captured.</p>

    <h3>Pearl Harbor (December 7)</h3>
    <p>On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese Imperial Navy launched a devastating surprise attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In two waves of attacks, Japanese aircraft sank or damaged 21 American ships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and killed 2,403 Americans.</p>
    <p>The attack was intended to cripple American naval power and prevent U.S. interference in Japanese expansion throughout Southeast Asia. Instead, it unified American public opinion and brought the United States into the war with a determination to achieve total victory.</p>

    <h2>The Eastern Front</h2>
    <p>The German invasion of the Soviet Union opened what would become the deadliest theater of World War II. The Eastern Front would see approximately 80% of all German military casualties and over 26 million Soviet deaths—military and civilian combined.</p>
    <p>Despite catastrophic losses, the Red Army did not collapse. The brutal Russian winter, Soviet resistance, and the overextension of German supply lines combined to halt the German advance before Moscow in December 1941. For the first time, Blitzkrieg had failed.</p>

    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
    <p>The events of 1941 fundamentally altered the course of the war. Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union opened a second front that would consume the bulk of German military power. The failure to capture Moscow before winter showed that Germany's resources were insufficient to conquer the vast Soviet Union in a single campaign.</p>
    <p>America's entry into the war was equally decisive. The United States would become the "Arsenal of Democracy," providing the weapons, equipment, and eventually the manpower that would enable the Allies to defeat the Axis powers. The Grand Alliance of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States—despite their ideological differences—would prove unstoppable.</p>
